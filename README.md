Welcome to the world of Tetris in Java, a classic puzzle game brought to life with modern programming. This Java implementation of Tetris combines the nostalgic charm of the original game with the versatility of Java.

**Game Overview:**
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players must manipulate falling blocks, called Tetrominoes, to create complete lines without gaps. Each completed line clears from the screen, earning the player points. The game ends when the Tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playing field.
